# UFOs
## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this analysis is to allow people to learn about and filter through an enormous amount of UFO sightings data. Whether it be the date of occurrence, city, state, country, or shape of the UFO, viewers can sift through the data to potentially find a specific event they are looking for. 

## Results
How a person can use the website is rather simple. On the left-hand side, under 'Filter Search', there are 5 fields in which someone can filter down the sighting results (date, city, state, country, shape). The user just enters an appropriate input given the examples shown by default, and either hit enter or click somewhere outside of the search field (see image below).
