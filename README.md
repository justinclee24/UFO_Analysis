# UFOs
## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this analysis is to allow people to learn about and filter through an enormous amount of UFO sightings data. Whether it be the date of occurrence, city, state, country, or shape of the UFO, viewers can sift through the data to potentially find a specific event they are looking for. 

## Results
How a person can use the website is rather simple. On the left-hand side, under 'Filter Search', there are 5 fields in which someone can filter down the sighting results (date, city, state, country, shape). The user just enters an appropriate input given the examples shown by default, and either hit enter or click somewhere outside of the search field (see image below).

## Summary
One drawback of the new design of the website is that it does not allow the user to filter for a certain duration of time nor a specific comment. For future development, I'd recommend adding portions to the code regarding this drawback that would include regex statements. These could also be applicable to the already existing filters so that the field would accept input in a variety of formats, such as the date. It would also be useful to be able to filter just by a year rather than a specific date. Finally, I'd also recommend that the filter button be brought back as it makes the filter process a bit more straight-forward.
